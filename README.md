# Introduction

This is a project to build the React frontend for a laptop-selling website, along with a simple Node.js server that connects to a PostgreSQL database.

The instructions in this README.md file have a Japanese section below. Please scroll down if needed.

## How to download and run it locally

Ensure that your computer has Node.js installed.

After cloning this repository to your computer, navigate to the cloned directory and type:

`npm install`

`npm start`

After ensuring that the website is running on localhost:3000, open another terminal and navigate to the server directory, and type:

`node server.js`

### Note

The website in the Vercel link provided in the About section above does not have a login functionality because this feature uses the Auth0 application, and the login link is configured for localhost:3000. To make changes, after running the source code on your machine, visit the Auth0 dashboard to reconfigure.
