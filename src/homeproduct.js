        Cat: 'Gaming',

        Describe: 'MSI GF63 Thin is proof you do not have to spend four figures to get a gaming laptop. In fact, there are quite a few options if you are willing to spend around $1,000. But for just $599, the base model of the GF63 (the 11SC-693) weâ€™re reviewing has a peppy Intel Core i5 H-class processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 graphics, a big step up from the usual low-wattage chips and integrated graphics common around this price point.'
