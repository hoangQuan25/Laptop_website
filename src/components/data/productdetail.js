    "Describe": "The Apple MacBook Air 15 is great for school use. Thanks to its thin and light design, it feels incredibly well-built and very portable. It has a sharp, bright display, a comfortable keyboard, and a large, responsive touchpad. Its M2 SoC can handle general productivity tasks and more demanding workloads like photo and video editing. The battery lasts about eight hours of light use, so depending on your usage, you may have to plug it in for a quick charge to get through the day.",

    "Describe": "MSI GF63 Thin is proof you do not have to spend four figures to get a gaming laptop. In fact, there are quite a few options if you are willing to spend around $1,000. But for just $599, the base model of the GF63 (the 11SC-693) we’re reviewing has a peppy Intel Core i5 H-class processor and Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 graphics, a big step up from the usual low-wattage chips and integrated graphics common around this price point.",
